1.0 out of 5.0 stars Constantly Crashing
I bought this computer because its a gaming laptop and has a decent graphics card. This computer will crash while playing games that are 15 years old. I've looked online and this is a pretty common issue. It seems that sending it back to customer support fixes the problem, but that just means they're knowingly making crap computers just to fix them later. DO NOT BUY THIS if you don't want to immediately send it back to be replaced.

Otherwise as an email and youtube machine it works great, fast boot, the bios could be more extensive.







5.0 out of 5.0 stars Outstanding Performance and Incredible Value for Gamers!
The Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop is an absolute beast for its price! The Intel Core i7-13620H processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 GPU deliver exceptional performance, handling even the most demanding games and applications with ease. I’ve been running AAA titles at high settings, and the 144Hz FHD IPS display ensures buttery-smooth visuals with stunning clarity and vibrant colors.

The 16GB DDR5 RAM and 512GB Gen 4 SSD provide a perfect balance of speed and storage. Multitasking is seamless, and load times are incredibly fast, whether I’m gaming, editing videos, or streaming content. The WiFi 6 ensures a rock-solid internet connection, even in crowded networks, making it ideal for online gaming.

The laptop’s design is sleek and modern, with a durable build that feels premium. The backlit keyboard is not only functional for low-light environments but also adds a touch of style. The cooling system works effectively, keeping the laptop cool even during long gaming sessions.

This machine checks all the boxes for a gaming laptop: powerful, efficient, and reasonably priced. Whether you’re a casual gamer or a serious enthusiast, the Acer Nitro V is a fantastic choice. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase and highly recommend it to anyone looking for top-tier performance without breaking the bank!
