5.0 out of 5.0 stars — Outstanding performance for the price, handling demanding games smoothly with its i7 processor, RTX 4050, and 144Hz display. Fast storage, effective cooling, and sleek design make it a great value for gamers.

1.0 out of 5 stars — Extremely slow performance out of the box despite high-end specs, freezing during restarts and failing to detect an external SSD. After hours with unhelpful support, I’m returning it — a huge disappointment from Acer.
